# Stuff Casey is interested in playing with

- Docker
- - Good for running complex, hard-to-build software: 'docker run -it caseyjlaw/docker-psr'.
- - Wrap bad software in python with sidomo
- - Run instances in the cloud with docker-machine (AWS example: https://gist.github.com/caseyjlaw/34b4d0f9f4aafac7af04)

Q. What is use case for pulsar analysis stack? How can we grow the docker image to support that?

- Jupyter
- - Good for interactive computing and documenting analysis.
- - Couple notebook with code as a "binder" for reproducible work: http://mybinder.org
