    "# Inspecting the 2011 GBT Raster Scan data set\n",

    "\n",
    "This data set was observed in 2011 by scanning back and forth (a [raster scan pattern](http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2007/41/aa7811-07/img52.gif) with the GBT over\n",
    "the entire [Kepler field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)) - i.e. the patch of sky the original Kepler mission observed.  This took about 11 hours, and the telescope was observing between 1.1 and 1.9 GHz.  Because the telescope was moving continuously over the sky, the dimensions of time and the 1-D position along the scan path cannot be disentagled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were recorded to disk in the raw \"baseband voltage\" format, and I searched through them for bright and relatively narrow-band signals.  This search was run by using a GPU-accelerated code to produce power spectra with effective integration times of ~4.8 seconds and resolutions of ~3 Hz.  In these spectra, I searched for all signals with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10.0 (after correcting for Doppler drifts between $\\pm$10 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a detected signal obviously persists for more than ~16 seconds (the time it takes the telescope to move ~15 arcminutes on the sky), then I know that the signal did not come from space and is local radio interference (i.e. it is \"confined\" on the sky).  A steady signal from a single point in space would only be detected as the telescope scanned over that spot.  If the signal could possibly have originated from a single point in space, I recorded a slice of that signal in a \"waterfall plot\" and recorded  some metadata (the signal-to-noise ratio, the time, and the coordinates on the sky we detected it).  If the signal did not pass our cut, however, then I only recorded the metadata in a big database and did not keep a waterfall plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because my code scanned the data in a rolling window averaging manner, and because many signals vary in brightness a lot over time, many bright signals were detected more than once.  In addition, the first pass through the data recorded many signals that passed my simple confined/not-confined algorithm but really weren't.  I trimmed this data set by implementing a more rigorous confined/not-confined test and by identifying all duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo notebook, I've packaged up the data from 1.4 to 1.5 GHz, which includes the hydrogen 21cm/1420MHz zone (a frequency that has historically been important for SETI searches).  This is ~1/8th of the total data from this data set, and I can package up and make available the rest of it if requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major goal is to identify sources of radio-wavelength flux from here on earth (Radio Frequency Interference, or RFI) from any possible signal from an astronomical source.  RFI is common, diverse, and pernicious.\n",
